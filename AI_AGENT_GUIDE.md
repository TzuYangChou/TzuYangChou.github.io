# AI Agent Guide

This file is generated from `agent-workbench` modules. Re-run the sync prompt to update it. Keep project-specific details in `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md`.

# Base Agent Guide

## Purpose

This guide is the vendor-neutral baseline for AI agents working in a project. It applies to Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and any other agent that can read repository files.

The canonical generated file in a consumer project is `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`. Vendor files such as `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` should only load or point to that guide and to `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md`.

## Language Policy

All artifacts committed to a repository must be written in English: code, comments, documentation, commit messages, configuration, and generated examples. Conversation with a user may use any language, but repository content should stay in English unless the project explicitly documents a different policy in `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md`.

## Operating Principles

- Prefer evidence over assumption; inspect files and run verification before claiming completion.
- Use the smallest reversible change that solves the real problem.
- Prefer current stable stacks, toolchains, runtimes, language standards, and project scaffolding for new work or upgrades unless project constraints require an older version.
- Preserve existing user behavior, public APIs, CLI flags, configuration formats, and machine-readable output unless the user explicitly requests a breaking change.
- Keep diffs focused and bisectable.
- Reuse existing project patterns before adding new abstractions.
- Prefer pragmatic, justified correctness over "it just worked" fixes; every solution should have a clear causal explanation and verification evidence.
- Do not add dependencies, services, code generators, plugins, marketplace entries, or global configuration without an explicit project decision.
- Treat project-local instructions as authoritative over generic guidance when they conflict.

## Standard Work Loop

1. Read the relevant instructions: `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` and `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` if present.
2. Understand the task and inspect the current implementation before editing.
3. For bug fixes or incident-style problems, identify the root cause with evidence before designing the solution. Test or justify the observation, rule out plausible alternatives, and do not present a root-cause fix unless confidence is complete; otherwise keep diagnosing or label the remaining uncertainty.
4. For non-trivial work, state or internally maintain a short plan: files to change, verification to run, and risks.
5. Make the minimal change.
6. Run the documented verification commands from `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` when available.
7. Review the diff for accidental edits, secrets, generated noise, and stale documentation.
8. Report changed files, verification evidence, and any remaining risks.

## Naming and Structure

- Use domain-specific names. Avoid vague containers such as `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, or `shared` unless the project already uses them intentionally.
- Spell names out. Avoid abbreviations unless they are standard in the language or domain.
- Source modules represent concepts and should usually use singular names.
- Data or collection directories that hold many peer files may use plural names.
- Prefer simple, explicit control flow and early returns over deeply nested conditions.
- Avoid hard-coded paths, variables, and constants. If a value appears repeatedly, is environment-specific, is arbitrary rather than canonical, or may change later, promote it to a named constant, configuration value, or documented boundary owned by the project.

## Output and Logging

Keep machine output and human diagnostics separate.

- Standard output is for command results or generated data.
- Standard error or the language logging framework is for progress, diagnostics, warnings, and errors.
- Library or domain code should not use raw print statements for status messages.
- Performance claims require measurements or profiling evidence.

## Dependency and External API Discipline

Before adopting or changing a dependency or SDK:

- Consult version-specific official documentation when possible.
- Prefer the latest stable supported release and toolchain compatible with the project; avoid obsolete stacks unless a documented constraint requires them.
- Confirm return values, error behavior, and edge cases with a minimal reproduction or test.
- Pin versions according to the project language ecosystem.
- Add or update integration tests when behavior crosses a boundary.
- Document the reason for the dependency if it is not obvious.

## Documentation Discipline

Update documentation when behavior, commands, configuration, public APIs, file layout, or onboarding instructions change. Stale documentation is a defect.

Treat `README.md` as user-facing product documentation. Keep it focused on what the project does, who it is for, how to install or use it, common workflows, troubleshooting, and support. Move maintainer-only architecture, exhaustive file trees, internal sync mechanics, and implementation notes into dedicated maintainer docs such as `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` unless a README reader explicitly needs them.

# Git and Change Management

## Safe Staging

- Stage only the files intentionally changed for the current task.
- Do not use broad staging commands such as `git add .` or `git add -A` unless the user explicitly asks and the diff has been reviewed.
- Inspect `git status` and relevant diffs before committing or summarizing work.

## Atomic Commit Discipline

- Make one logical change per commit. Split unrelated fixes, refactors, dependency updates, formatting-only changes, and documentation updates unless they are necessary parts of the same intent.
- Keep each commit atomic, reviewable, reversible, and bisectable.
- Do not hide speculative cleanup inside a feature or bug-fix commit.

## History Safety

- Do not run destructive history or working-tree commands (`git reset --hard`, `git clean`, force push, branch deletion, interactive rebase) unless explicitly authorized for the current task.
- Do not bypass hooks or checks with `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix or document the underlying cause.
- Keep commits focused and reversible.

## Pre-commit Enforcement

- Prefer project-scoped pre-commit hooks that enforce the project's formatter, linter, type checker, tests, and other required checks.
- Keep hook commands deterministic, documented, and fast enough for routine commits; move long-running checks to CI when necessary.
- Treat hook failures as evidence to investigate. Do not bypass them unless the user explicitly accepts the risk for that commit.

## Commit Messages

Every commit must use a Conventional Commit subject line and explain why the change exists, not just what files changed.

Subject format:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <intent-oriented summary>
```

Use standard types such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, and `ci`. Choose the type that best describes the user-visible intent of the change.

For non-trivial commits, include useful Lore trailers when they clarify constraints, rejected alternatives, risk, or verification.

Example shape:

```text
refactor: make agent instructions portable across vendors

The repository now generates one canonical guide and keeps vendor
entrypoints thin so projects can use Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, or
OpenCode without duplicating policy.

Constraint: Sync must not require global configuration or marketplaces
Rejected: Git submodule distribution | too intrusive for consumer projects
Confidence: high
Scope-risk: moderate
Tested: Inspected generated files and sync prompt invariants
```

## Review Before Final Response

Before reporting completion:

- Confirm no unrelated files were modified.
- Confirm generated or managed files contain expected markers.
- Confirm project-specific files were preserved.
- Include verification commands and outcomes.

# Workspace Configuration Orphan Branch

Use a dedicated orphan Git branch named `workspace-config` for reproducible local workspace overlays such as agent instructions, editor settings, prompts, and local automation. This keeps product branches clean while still versioning the files an agent or developer needs to recreate the same workspace.

Recommended repository shape:

```text
same project repo
├─ main                # clean product branch
├─ dev                 # clean integration branch
├─ feature/*           # normal product work
└─ workspace-config    # orphan workspace overlay branch, never merged
```

## Core Invariant

`workspace-config` must never be merged, rebased, or cherry-picked wholesale into `main`, `dev`, or product feature branches.

Product branches must not track workspace-only files. Workspace files may physically exist in a normal product worktree, but they must stay ignored locally through `.git/info/exclude`, not through project `.gitignore`, unless the project explicitly decides those paths are project-wide policy.

## What Belongs in `workspace-config`

The branch is for reproducible local development setup, not product source code. Core agent-workbench overlay files include the human config and the agent-owned provenance ledger:

```text
AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md
AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
GEMINI.md
.agent-workbench.yaml
.agent-workbench.lock.json
.agents/
.codex/
.claude/
opencode.json
```

Additional local workspace paths may also belong on `workspace-config` when they are not project-owned:

```text
.agent/
.cursor/
.vscode/
prompts/
scripts/
```

Exceptions are allowed only when a file is intentionally part of the project for all contributors. For example, a repository may choose to track `.vscode/extensions.json`, `prompts/`, or `scripts/` on `main`; if so, document that exception in `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md`.

## What Belongs on Product Branches

`main`, `dev`, and `feature/*` should contain product source code, product documentation, tests, and configuration required by the actual application or library.

They should not track local workspace overlays such as agent prompts, editor workspaces, local automation, or vendor-specific AI-agent files unless the project explicitly promotes that file into project policy.

## Initial Setup

Create the orphan branch from the repository root:

```bash
git status --short
git switch --orphan workspace-config
git rm -rf .
```

Start only from a clean product worktree. If `git status --short` shows changes, preserve or commit them before switching branches.

Create or restore the workspace files, then commit them:

```bash
git add AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md .agent-workbench.yaml .agent-workbench.lock.json .agents .codex .claude opencode.json
git commit -m "chore: add workspace config overlay"
git push -u origin workspace-config
```

Add optional workspace-only paths such as `.cursor/`, `.vscode/`, `prompts/`, or `scripts/` only after confirming they are not product-owned.

Return to product development:

```bash
git switch main
```

If the branch was previously named `agent-config`, rename it:

```bash
git switch agent-config
git branch -m workspace-config
git push origin :agent-config
git push -u origin workspace-config
```

## Local Excludes on Product Branches

In the normal product worktree, add workspace-overlay paths to `.git/info/exclude`. Use local excludes instead of `.gitignore` because this is local workspace policy, not necessarily product policy.

Bash:

```bash
cat >> .git/info/exclude <<'EOF'
AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md
AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
GEMINI.md
.agent-workbench.yaml
.agent-workbench.lock.json
.agents/
.codex/
.claude/
opencode.json
EOF
```

Append optional paths such as `.agent/`, `.cursor/`, `.vscode/`, `prompts/`, or `scripts/` only when the project treats them as workspace-only.

PowerShell:

```powershell
@"
AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md
AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
GEMINI.md
.agent-workbench.yaml
.agent-workbench.lock.json
.agents/
.codex/
.claude/
opencode.json
"@ | Add-Content .git/info/exclude
```

Append optional paths such as `.agent/`, `.cursor/`, `.vscode/`, `prompts/`, or `scripts/` only when the project treats them as workspace-only.

## Restore Workspace Files into a Product Worktree

On a new machine or fresh clone:

```bash
git clone <project-url> my-project
cd my-project
git restore --source=origin/workspace-config -- AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md .agent-workbench.yaml .agent-workbench.lock.json .agents .codex .claude opencode.json
```

Then add the local excludes shown above. After this, the workspace files physically exist in the product worktree but are not tracked by product branches.

## Updating Workspace Config

Prefer a temporary worktree for updates so the orphan branch remains isolated:

```bash
git worktree add ../my-project-workspace-config workspace-config
```

Copy the updated workspace files from the product worktree into that temporary worktree:

```bash
cp -r AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md .agent-workbench.yaml .agent-workbench.lock.json .agents .codex .claude opencode.json ../my-project-workspace-config/
```

PowerShell alternative:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md, AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, .agent-workbench.yaml, .agent-workbench.lock.json, .agents, .codex, .claude, opencode.json ..\my-project-workspace-config\
```

Commit from the temporary worktree:

```bash
cd ../my-project-workspace-config
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: update workspace config overlay"
git push
```

Refresh local workspace files in the product worktree:

```bash
git restore --source=origin/workspace-config -- AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md .agent-workbench.yaml .agent-workbench.lock.json .agents .codex .claude opencode.json
```

## If Workspace Files Are Already Tracked on a Product Branch

Remove them from the product branch index while preserving the physical files:

```bash
git rm -r --cached AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md .agent-workbench.yaml .agent-workbench.lock.json .agents .codex .claude opencode.json
git commit -m "chore: stop tracking local workspace config"
```

Then ensure `.git/info/exclude` contains those paths and commit the files on `workspace-config`. The `.agent-workbench.lock.json` file belongs with this overlay because it records the last sync baseline used to detect confirmed upstream removal, confirmed removal with local edits, suspected legacy removal, deselected by local config, source changed / migration required, local unmanaged artifacts, and retainedRemovals context.

## Agent Rules

When working in a repository that uses this design:

1. Treat `main`, `dev`, and `feature/*` as product-code branches.
2. Treat `workspace-config` as an orphan branch for local development overlay files.
3. Never merge `workspace-config` into a product branch.
4. Never add workspace-only files to product branches.
5. Restore workspace files from `workspace-config` when they are needed in a normal worktree.
6. Commit workspace-file updates on `workspace-config`, preferably through a temporary worktree.
7. Use `.git/info/exclude` to keep restored workspace files untracked on product branches.
8. Before committing on a product branch, run `git status --short` and confirm workspace files are not staged.

Git has no native rule that means "track these files on `dev`, but automatically omit them when merging into `main`." Therefore `dev` must remain clean, and `workspace-config` is the versioned storage location for local workspace configuration.

# Security and Safety

## Secrets and Sensitive Data

- Never commit secrets, tokens, private keys, credentials, `.env` files, local database dumps, or personal data.
- If sensitive material appears in the working tree, stop and report it without copying the secret into logs or summaries.
- Do not print secret values. Redact them when context is necessary.

## Scope Boundaries

- Modify only files relevant to the requested task.
- Do not modify application source code during an agent-workbench sync unless the user separately requests application changes.
- Do not install dependencies, plugins, marketplaces, extensions, or global/user-scope configuration as part of instruction sync.
- Prefer project-scoped configuration over user-scoped configuration.
- Do not rely on machine-local absolute paths in committed files.

## Generated Instruction Files

Managed instruction files may be regenerated by the sync prompt. Project-specific manual content belongs in `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` or inside explicit manual preservation blocks in `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`.

The sync process may update only:

- `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`
- `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` when it is missing
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `GEMINI.md`
- `opencode.json`
- `.codex/config.toml`
- `.agent-workbench.yaml`
- `.agent-workbench.lock.json` provenance ledger
- Registered portable prompts under `.agents/prompts/`
- Registered portable skills under `.agents/skills/`
- Generated Claude project skills under `.claude/skills/` when the Claude target is enabled

Any broader edit requires explicit user authorization. Sync may classify generated artifacts as confirmed upstream removal, confirmed removal with local edits, suspected legacy removal, deselected by local config, source changed / migration required, or local unmanaged, but it must not delete downstream artifacts without explicit user confirmation. Deletion candidates must be normalized, allowlisted workspace-overlay paths; local/unmanaged artifacts are preserved by default, and kept removals should be recorded in `retainedRemovals`.

## High-Risk Operations

Ask for explicit confirmation before destructive, irreversible, production-affecting, or credential-dependent operations. If a safe read-only inspection can answer the question, do that first.

# Testing and Verification

## Test-First Bias

For feature work and bug fixes, prefer this loop:

1. Add or extend a test that proves the expected behavior.
2. Run it and confirm it fails for the expected reason when practical.
3. Implement the minimal fix.
4. Run the targeted test and the broader project checks documented in `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md`.
5. Refactor only while tests stay green.

If the project lacks tests, use the lightest reliable verification available and state the gap.

## Root Cause and Proof Discipline

- For bug fixes, first reproduce or precisely characterize the failure, then identify the causal mechanism before changing behavior.
- Test or justify each root-cause observation and rule out plausible alternatives. Do not accept "it just worked" as evidence of correctness.
- Begin solution work only after the root cause is proven with complete confidence. If complete confidence is not currently possible, keep the change experimental, state the uncertainty, and avoid broad or irreversible edits.

## Verification Selection

Choose verification proportional to risk:

- Documentation-only change: render or inspect relevant Markdown/configuration and check links or examples when practical.
- Small code change: targeted tests plus formatter/linter if available.
- Multi-file or behavior change: targeted tests, broader suite, type checks, lint, and documentation review.
- Security or data-mutation change: add negative tests, boundary tests, and explicit rollback or recovery notes.

## Clean Output

A successful verification run should have no unexplained warnings, formatter diffs, or stale generated output. If checks fail for pre-existing reasons, document the exact command and failure summary.

## Project Commands

Use `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` as the source of truth for build and test commands. If commands are missing, infer conservatively from standard manifests and report the assumption.

# Review Discipline

Use a skeptical review stance: correctness and simplicity beat cleverness and speed.

## Review Checklist

For each meaningful change, ask:

- Does this solve a real requested problem?
- Is there a simpler approach that removes a special case instead of adding branches?
- Could this regress existing CLI flags, configuration formats, public APIs, or output shapes?
- Are feature changes tangled with unrelated refactors?
- Are tests or verification appropriate for the risk?
- Are documentation and examples still accurate?
- Are new abstractions justified by current duplication, performance evidence, or clear boundary needs?
- Are repeated or non-canonical values hard-coded when they should be constants, configuration, or documented project boundaries?
- Are error paths and edge cases explicit?
- Are performance claims backed by measurements?
- Is the root cause proven, or is the change merely an "it just worked" workaround?
- Did any generated, local, or secret file get touched accidentally?

## NACK Triggers

Treat these as blockers unless the user explicitly accepts the risk:

- Hidden behavior changes without tests or migration notes.
- Broad rewrite when a small fix would work.
- New dependency without a clear reason and version pinning.
- Optimization without measurements.
- "It just worked" fixes without a proven root cause, targeted verification, or a clear correctness argument.
- Repeated hard-coded paths, values, variables, or constants that are arbitrary, environment-specific, or likely to change.
- Large duplicated guide content in vendor-specific entrypoints.
- Agent sync changing application source code.

## Summary Standard

Final summaries should include:

- Changed files grouped by purpose.
- Verification commands and results.
- Manual content preserved or created.
- Remaining risks or follow-up items.

# Portable Agent Workflows

Every synchronized project should carry the same core agent workflows regardless of which vendor agent is active. Treat these as portable capabilities, not Claude plugins, Codex-only skills, or Gemini-only extensions.

Use a hybrid strategy:

```text
canonical neutral capability
        -> thin vendor adapter or generated vendor surface
        -> optional official implementation, when available
```

The canonical capability is the source of truth. Vendor-native skills, commands, hooks, extensions, or plugins are accelerators and adapters; they must not become independently maintained copies of the workflow.

## Canonical Project-Local Locations

- `.agents/prompts/` stores reusable prompt workflows that any capable coding agent can read and execute.
- `.agents/skills/` stores portable Agent Skills using `SKILL.md` folders.
- `.agents/guardrails/` stores vendor-neutral guardrail rule documents.
- `capabilities/<name>/capability.yaml` records the portability level, canonical skill/prompt files, vendor outputs, and official-preferred fallbacks.
- `.agent-workbench.lock.json` records agent-owned sync provenance: source commit, manifest digest, scoped baselines, installed artifacts, and retained removals. Keep `.agent-workbench.yaml` as human-owned desired configuration.

Vendor-native discovery paths such as `.codex/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.gemini/commands/`, or hook config files may be generated as optional mirrors only when the project explicitly wants them. The canonical source remains under `.agents/`.

Claude Code is the main exception for skill discovery: when the Claude target is enabled, sync may generate project skills under `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` from the same canonical capability so Claude can discover them natively. These generated files are adapter surfaces, not new sources of truth.

## Portability Levels

- `portable-guide`: guidance belongs in `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md`; no separate skill is required.
- `portable-skill`: a neutral `SKILL.md` expresses the workflow well across vendors.
- `vendor-adapted`: the concept is shared, but execution needs vendor-specific config, hooks, permissions, or commands.
- `official-preferred`: a vendor has a native implementation that should be used first when present; keep the neutral skill as fallback.

## Required Portable Capabilities

Each project should have these workflows available after sync:

| Capability | Canonical artifact | Replaces or abstracts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workbench sync and audit | `.agents/prompts/sync-agent-workbench.md`, `.agents/prompts/audit-agent-workbench.md`, `.agents/prompts/repair-agent-workbench.md`, `.agents/skills/sync-agent-workbench/SKILL.md` | `claude-md-management`, `claude-code-setup` |
| Loop until done | `.agents/prompts/loop-until-done.md`, `.agents/skills/loop-until-done/SKILL.md` | `ralph-loop` |
| Guardrail authoring | `.agents/prompts/create-guardrail.md`, `.agents/skills/guardrail-authoring/SKILL.md` | `hookify` |
| Skill authoring | `.agents/prompts/create-agent-skill.md`, `.agents/skills/skill-authoring/SKILL.md` | `skill-creator` |
| Commit workflow | `.agents/prompts/commit-workflow.md`, `.agents/skills/commit-workflow/SKILL.md` | `commit-commands` |
| Linus-style review | `.agents/prompts/linus-review.md`, `.agents/skills/linus-review/SKILL.md` | strict maintainer review mode |

## Portability Rules

- Treat install as the first sync. The same sync workflow should detect new, legacy/no-lockfile, and already-managed repositories.
- Use `.agent-workbench.lock.json` as a provenance/baseline ledger, not a package-manager lockfile. Use it with the current desired set to detect removed or deselected managed artifacts.
- Classify sync drift with explicit statuses: confirmed upstream removal, confirmed removal with local edits, suspected legacy removal, deselected by local config, source changed / migration required, and local unmanaged.
- Never delete generated downstream artifacts without explicit user confirmation. If a user keeps a removed artifact, record that decision in `retainedRemovals` so future syncs preserve context.
- Do not make a consumer project depend on a marketplace, global extension, user-scope config, or machine-local absolute path to get these workflows.
- Prefer a prompt or portable skill first unless the capability is marked `official-preferred` for the active vendor.
- Use vendor-specific hooks, slash commands, plugins, or extensions as generated adapters only.
- Keep the vendor-specific adapter thin: it should point to the `.agents/` prompt, skill, or guardrail instead of duplicating the workflow.
- Do not symlink skills for portability; copy managed skill folders when a vendor-specific mirror is required.
- Keep generated project workflows in English and project-local.
- Do not manually maintain four full copies of the same skill. Maintain one canonical capability plus small vendor adapters.

## When a Vendor Has a Native Equivalent

Native equivalents are allowed as accelerators, not as the source of truth:

- Codex: built-in `$skill-creator` and project/user skills can help author or consume Agent Skills.
- Gemini: Agent Skills and extensions can load skills, hooks, and commands; Ralph-style looping can be implemented with `AfterAgent` hooks.
- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md`, custom commands, hooks, and plugins can adapt the same workflows.

If a native feature is missing, unstable, or disabled, execute the `.agents/prompts/*.md` workflow directly.
