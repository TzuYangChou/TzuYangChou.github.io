description: Prepare, verify, stage, and create atomic one-logical-change git commits with Conventional Commit subjects, enabled pre-commit hooks, and optional Lore trailers. Use when a user asks to commit, prepare a commit, write a commit message, push, or open a PR, replacing vendor-specific commit command plugins with a portable project workflow.

# Commit Workflow

## Workflow

1. Read `.agents/prompts/commit-workflow.md` if present.
2. Run `git status --short`.
3. Inspect relevant diffs before staging.
4. Confirm the commit contains exactly one logical change; split unrelated edits.
5. Run project verification when practical.
6. Stage only intentional files.
7. Re-check staged diff.
8. Commit with an intent-oriented Conventional Commit subject and enabled pre-commit hooks.
9. Add Lore trailers for non-trivial decisions when useful.
10. Push or open a PR only if explicitly requested.

## Safety

Never stage unrelated files, bypass hooks, push, rewrite history, or run destructive git commands without explicit authorization. Treat pre-commit hook failures as issues to diagnose and fix, not as obstacles to skip.
