# Loop Until Done Prompt

Use this vendor-neutral workflow when a user wants an agent to keep working until a verifiable task is complete. It replaces tool-specific Ralph-loop plugins when those are unavailable or undesired.

## Inputs

Determine these values from the user request or choose safe defaults:

- **Task**: the concrete outcome to achieve.
- **Completion criteria**: observable facts that prove the work is done.
- **Root-cause claim**: for bug fixes, the causal mechanism proven by inspection, reproduction, tests, or other evidence.
- **Maximum iterations**: default to 5 unless the user specified another limit.
- **Verification commands**: use `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` first; otherwise infer conservatively.

## Loop Protocol

For each iteration:

1. Read `AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md` and `AI_AGENT_PROJECT.md` if present.
2. Inspect the current repository state before editing.
3. Maintain a short task checklist in the conversation or in a project-local scratch file only if useful.
4. For bug fixes or unexplained failures, reproduce or precisely characterize the problem, form a root-cause hypothesis, and test or justify it. Do not implement a solution until the root cause is proven with complete confidence; if confidence remains incomplete, continue diagnosis or report the uncertainty instead of shipping an "it just worked" workaround.
5. Make the smallest reversible change that advances the task.
6. Run the verification needed to test the current claim.
7. Inspect `git status --short` and relevant diffs.
8. Decide:
   - If completion criteria are satisfied, stop and report evidence.
   - If verification failed and the iteration limit is not reached, diagnose and continue.
   - If blocked, try a safe alternative before escalating.
   - If the iteration limit is reached, stop with the current evidence and remaining blockers.

## Hard Stops

Stop immediately when:

- The user cancels or changes the task.
- Continuing requires destructive, irreversible, production-affecting, credential-gated, or scope-changing action not already authorized.
- The completion criteria are impossible or ambiguous enough that further work would be guesswork.

## Final Response

Report:

- Iterations used.
- Files changed.
- Root cause and evidence, when solving a bug or failure.
- Verification commands and outcomes.
- Completion criteria satisfied.
- Remaining risks or blocked items.
